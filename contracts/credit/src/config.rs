//! Contract initialization and configuration helpers.
//!
//! # What
//!
//! - [`init`] — one-time initialization. Sets the admin address, the
//!   default liquidity source (the contract's own address), the schema
//!   version, the initial global accumulators (`CreditLineCount = 0`,
//!   `TotalUtilized = 0`), and a default minimum collateral ratio of
//!   15 000 bps (150 %) — i.e. the contract ships in a conservative
//!   collateral-required mode and is loosened by admin policy.
//! - [`set_liquidity_token`] — admin sets the SAC / token contract used
//!   for `transfer` and `transfer_from` operations on draw, repay, and
//!   collateral movement.
//! - [`set_liquidity_source`] — admin sets the reserve address that
//!   funds draws. Defaults to the credit contract's own address; a
//!   production deployment typically points this at a separate reserve
//!   pool contract.
//!
//! # How
//!
//! `init`'s re-init guard checks `Symbol("admin")` presence in instance
//! storage. A second `init` call reverts with
//! [`ContractError::AlreadyInitialized`]; the admin address therefore
//! cannot be overwritten by re-initialization, only by the two-step
//! rotation in [`crate::lib::propose_admin`] /
//! [`crate::lib::accept_admin`].
//!
//! # Why (deployment-safe defaults)
//!
//! Shipping `init` with conservative defaults — 150 % collateral floor,
//! contract-as-its-own-reserve-source, schema version 1 — means a
//! freshly deployed contract is immediately safe to attach to a
//! liquidity token without exposure to the protocol's untuned risk
//! parameters. The admin then dials in the rate formula, exposure caps,
//! and so on before opening the first credit line.
//!
//! A full working deployment requires:
//! 1. `init`
//! 2. `set_liquidity_token` (required for drawing)
//! 3. `set_liquidity_source` (unsafe default uses contract's own address)
//! 4. `set_min_collateral_ratio_bps` (optional)
//! 5. `set_auction_contract` (wiring credit to auction)
//! 6. `set_factory_contract` (on auction side, wiring back to credit)
//!
//! See [`docs/deploy.md`](../../../docs/deploy.md) for the required
//! deployment sequence, CLI commands, and a smoke test sequence, and
//! [`docs/EXECUTION_QUALITY.md`](../../../docs/EXECUTION_QUALITY.md) §6
//! for the full testnet / mainnet checklist.
